  into small groups having at most 3 members and a class project will be given to them for preparing
  a system test case. They must validate the requirements and create Mock UIs during the preparation
  of test cases. Besides, each of the students will relate their learnings on unit, regression,
  performance and security testing, debugging, behavior driven development via different tools like
  JUnit, Selenium, Apache JMeter, Sprajax, Sqlninja, Bugzilla, Cucumber.</p><br>
