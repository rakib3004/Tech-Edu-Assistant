<br><h3><b><u>Course Outline:</u> </b>Each of the students should complete the software project separately. They will be
  marked based on their individual software. Student will be encouraged to develop software which
  requires significant “problem solving” effort. The project should be sufficiently large and the size
  of the project will mostly depend on “problem solving” effort. Besides, students must showcase the
  skills they have acquired from their so far completed courses./h3><br>
